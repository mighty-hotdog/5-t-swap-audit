## About TSwap

TSwap is a Distributed Exchange (DEX), similiar to Uniswap.

Using smart contracts (ie: code), it does the following:
1. serves as an `Automated Market Maker (AMM)` to `Token Swappers (UserType #1)` who wish to exchange their tokens from 1 type to another type.
   - TSwap facilitates this exchange (aka swap) according to `prevailing market rates [^1]`,
   - and charges a `small fee for the swap`, which is (currently) 100% `paid to the Liquidity Providers`.

2. manages `Liquidity Pools` that facilitate the swaps.
   - Liquidity Pools are token pools containing supplies of every tokens type that TSwap supports swaps in.
   - Given a swap request (from a Token Swapper) to swap a certain amount of Token A to Token B, the Liquidity Pools for Token A and Token B provide the token supply for the swap to happen.
   - These Liquidity Pools are supplied by `Liquidity Providers (UserType #2)`.
   - Liquidity Providers are the TSwap users who make their tokens available to TSwap to be used to facilitate token swaps.
   - Liquidity Providers are incentivized to contribute their tokens to the Liquidity Pools by the swap fees that they will receive (TSwap collects this from Token Swappers and pays this to Liquidity Providers).
   - Contributing tokens to Liquidity Pools is similiar to a `deposit` or `staking` functionality where TSwap the deposit acceptor guarantees that the deposited tokens will not suffer depletions and can be `withdrawn` or `unstaked` partially or fully by the Liquidity Providers, subject to `terms and conditions for deposit/staking and withdrawal/unstaking` actions, as specified in advance by TSwap.

[^1]: how does TSwap do it really? the exchange rate mechanism can be a complicated algorithm that takes into account the current exchange rate of the cryto market at large, as well as the relative supply of and demand for specific tokens within their Liquidity Pools on TSwap.

## Into the Code

### Contracts
1. **PoolFactory**
   - The protocol starts as simply a `PoolFactory contract`. This contract is used to create new "pools" of tokens. It helps make sure every pool token uses the correct logic. But all the magic is in each TSwapPool contract.

2. **TSwapPool**
   - You can think of each `TSwapPool contract` as its own exchange between exactly 2 assets. Any ERC20 and the WETH token. These pools allow users to permissionlessly swap between an ERC20 that has a pool and WETH. Once enough pools are created, users can easily "hop" between supported ERC20s.
   - For example:
        ```
        User A has 10 USDC
        They want to use it to buy DAI
        They swap their 10 USDC -> WETH in the USDC/WETH pool
        Then they swap their WETH -> DAI in the DAI/WETH pool
        Every pool is a pair of TOKEN X & WETH.
        ```

   - There are 2 functions users can call to swap tokens in the pool.
     - swapExactInput
     - swapExactOutput
